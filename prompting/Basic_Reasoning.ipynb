Summarizing Conditions:\n\n* **Condition 1:** 1 in 5 dice are weighted.\n* **Condition 2:** Weighted dice always roll a 6.\n* **Condition 3:** A person rolled a 6.\n\n## 2. Identifying the Problem:\n\nThe problem asks whether it is more likely that the die that rolled a 6 was weighted or not.\n\n## 3. Providing a Clear Solution:\n\nThis problem can be solved using Bayes' Theorem.\n\nLet's define:\n\n* **A:** The event of rolling a 6.\n* **B:** The event of having a weighted die.\n\nWe want to find **P(B|A)**, the probability of having a weighted die given that a 6 was rolled.\n\nBayes' Theorem states:\n\n**P(B|A) = [P(A|B) * P(B)] / P(A)**\n\nLet's break down each part:\n\n* **P(A|B):** Probability of rolling a 6 given a weighted die. This is 1 (or 100%), as the weighted die always rolls a 6.\n* **P(B):** Prior probability of having a weighted die. This is 1/5 (or 20%), as 1 in 5 dice are weighted.\n* **P(A):** Probability of rolling a 6, regardless of the die.  We can calculate this using the law of total probability:\n    * **P(A) = P(A|B) * P(B) + P(A|not B) * P(not B)**\n    * **P(A|not B):** Probability of rolling a 6 with a fair die is 1/6.\n    * **P(not B):** Probability of having a fair die is 4/5 (or 80%).\n\nTherefore, P(A) = (1 * 1/5) + (1/6 * 4/5) = 1/5 + 2/15 = 1/3.\n\nNow, plugging back into Bayes' Theorem:\n\n**P(B|A) = (1 * 1/5) / (1/3) = 3/5 = 0.6**\n\n## 4. Explanation:\n\nThe probability of having a weighted die given that a 6 was rolled is 0.6 or 60%. This is higher than the prior probability of having a weighted die (20%). Therefore, it is more likely that the die was weighted.\n\n**In simpler terms:** It's more likely that the die was weighted because weighted dice always roll a 6, while fair dice only have a 1/6 chance of rolling a 6. Even though there are more fair dice, the fact that the person rolled a 6 makes it more probable that they had the rarer weighted die. \n"
