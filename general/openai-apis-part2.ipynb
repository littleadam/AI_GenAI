The local medical superintendent was transferred after attributing the deaths to the heat, and a state-appointed team visited to assess the situation. However, the team expressed doubts about the heat being the sole factor, noting that nearby districts had lower death tolls. The article emphasizes that the impact of a heatwave depends on various factors such as infrastructure, social security, access to resources, and general well-being. It highlights the need for literacy and resources to address the climate crisis and prevent heat-related deaths. The article also calls for proper documentation and reporting of heat-related deaths to facilitate research and policy-making. The lack of released reports on heat-related deaths is criticized, and the article suggests that if good living conditions are not the norm, the state shares responsibility for heat-related fatalities.\n"
